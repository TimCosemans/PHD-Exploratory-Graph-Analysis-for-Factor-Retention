# README for the repository
Repository for the publication 'Exploratory Graph Analysis for Factor  Retention: Simulation Results for Continuous and Binary Data' in Educational and Psychological Measurement by T. Cosemans, S. Gelper and Y. Rosseel (https://doi.org/10.1177/00131644211059089). 

Each of the files are commented as to explain the use of each piece of code. This README contains an overview of which scripts are used. 

- PCM: generates population correlation matrices based on interfactor correlations and communalities, used at the beginning of each chapter
- Sampling: samples from the population correlation matrix generated by 'PCM'
- Factor retention: main script 
- Factor retention procedures: contains functions that each return the amount of factors to retain
- ResultsFRC.csv: contains the results discussed in the publication
